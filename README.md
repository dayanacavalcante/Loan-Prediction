# Loan Prediction

The Dream Housing Finance is a home loan company. The company wants to automate the loan process by filling in a online application form for the client.

The client informs the following data: Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others.

It's a classification problem because it will be predicted whether the loan will be accepted or not.
